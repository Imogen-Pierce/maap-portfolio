### Matt Anderson

Based in the southeast corner of Connecticut's picturesque shoreline, Matt Anderson has combined his passion for photography and travel to capture beautiful images from a unique perspective. 

Matt is an FAA licensed drone pilot and has been flying for years both locally and worldwide. 
Matt believes that aerial photography offers more than just a different angle, it provides a new way to appreciate the world around us, offering patterns, textures and scales often unseen from the ground and our daily perspectives. 

Contact Matt to discuss your next project from outdoor events, landscapes or commercial inspections. If you have an idea, Matt can work with you to create your vision.
